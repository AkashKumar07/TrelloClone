# Introduction

I have created the basic clone of trello app. This web app consists of basic kanban boards, wherein, we can add a list or a board, move them and delete them. Similarly, we can also add a card with a tast written in it, move it from one list or board to another and delete it.

## How to use this web app on the local machine

You can either clone or download the zip file of the repository. After that, you have to open it with your favourite editor and run the following commands in the terminal:

##### npm install

This command installs all the npm packages that are to be needed in order to run the app. This is done based on the package.json file, wherein, we have all the packages mentioned that have used in this web app. 

##### npm start

This command starts up the app on the local device at http://localhost:3000.

## npm packages used
- create-react-app : For setting up a react application.
- redux : for state management.
- react-redux : for state management
- react-beautiful-dnd : For the Drag and Drop feature in the application.
